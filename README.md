# Eduardo's Dotfiles (***WORK IN PROGRESS***)

A set of dotfiles tailored towards Arch Linux (and derivative) distros. Currently tailored for
my workflow in hyprland, and eventually any other Wayland compositors I choose to support.

## To-Dos
- Build dependency list (and make a script to install them)
- Add SwayWM compatibility
